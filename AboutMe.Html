        <h4>I feel these two objectives were the Foundation for my Adult Life</h4>
        <p>When I joined the Navy that was the beginning of a lifelong journy to improve my life</p>
        <p>After the Navy the opportunity to be educated in Boston was a true Blessing</p>
        <p>I think that this "Bootcamp," will be another chapter in which to build upon</p>
        <p>If my back and shoulder can handle the desk chair..lol</p>
